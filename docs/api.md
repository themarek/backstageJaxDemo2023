# API Documentation

Thank you for choosing our documentation software. Our API is designed to help developers build software applications that interact with our documentation software. In this documentation, we will guide you through the components of our API and how to use them.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated with an API key. You can generate an API key by logging in to your account on our website and navigating to the API settings page. Once you have an API key, you can use it to authenticate all API requests.

## Endpoints

Our API provides the following endpoints:

Projects - This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all the projects in your account, as well as create, update, and delete projects.

Pages - This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all the pages in a specific project, as well as create, update, and delete pages.

Categories - This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all the categories in a specific project, as well as create, update, and delete categories.

Users - This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all the users in your account, as well as create, update, and delete users.

## API Requests

All API requests must be sent using HTTPS. The endpoint URL must be prefixed with https://api.yourdomain.com/ followed by the endpoint path. For example, to retrieve a list of projects, you would send a GET request to https://api.yourdomain.com/projects.

## API Responses

All API responses are returned in JSON format. The response body will contain the requested data or an error message if the request was unsuccessful. The response status code will indicate whether the request was successful or not.
